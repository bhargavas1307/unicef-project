# Data Analytics Project on Diarrhea Treatment Coverage
This project provides an analysis of diarrhea treatment coverage for children up to 5 years of age across various countries, with a specific focus on Afghanistan.
We explore the correlation between GDP per capita and the treatment coverage of diarrhea among children.
Additionally, we examine the population trends in Afghanistan over time in relation to diarrhea treatment indicators.
