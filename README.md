# Data Analytics Project on Diarrhoea Treatment Coverage
This project provides an analysis of diarrhoea treatment coverage for children up to 5 years of age across various countries, with a specific focus on Afghanistan.
We explore the correlation between GDP per capita and the treatment coverage of diarrhoea among children.
Additionally, we examine the population trends in Afghanistan over time in relation to diarrhoea treatment indicators.
